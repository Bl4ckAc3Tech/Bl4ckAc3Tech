Hello! My name is BLACK ACE and I am a cyber security and information security professional and bug bounty hunter with a background in Office Technology and Management.
While I may not have a traditional computer science background, I have always been fascinated by the world of cybersecurity and the importance of protecting sensitive information.

I have worked hard to educate myself on the latest technologies and best practices in the field, and I am constantly seeking out new opportunities to learn and grow. In addition to my experiences.

As a bug bounty hunter, I use my skills and knowledge to identify vulnerabilities in systems and report them to companies, 
I am a bug bounty hunter, actively searching for and reporting vulnerabilities in systems and software to ensure their security.
This allows me to not only contribute to the overall security of the internet, but also continue learning and improving my skills.
